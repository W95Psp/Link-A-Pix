Sorry for the mess this code is, it's made of few hours and coffee (not the language, the drink, like https://www.pehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cofee1-1024x682.jpg)

Some stuff could be muuuch more optimised, that's really not the point here! (I don't what the point it is, in fact x) )

That's a solver in JS for this problem:
